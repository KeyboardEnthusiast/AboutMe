	<font face="verdana" color="#A94FFC" > Me and bobby really enjoy playing with each other. We would talk about things, laugh about things. We are very very good friends together. I have been here at basis for 2 years. I made a lot of friends along the way, and i like a lot of them. I really like playing games. I also really like building keyboards. They are just so fun and they are just so easy to customize.I really like going to school. I can talk to all of my friends and i can also play with them everyday. I really like tech and building computers too. I have 1 phone and 1 ipad, and no computer. I will be getting a computer some time later, i get to build it all by myself！！！！11</font>
