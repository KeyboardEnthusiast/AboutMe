<font face="verdana" color="#FFF93D">My favorite hobby is to build keyboards. They are so interesting and they are so fun to build. You can build your own keyboard just the way you want to. And all acording to your own preference. </font>
<font face="verdana" color="#A000FF">I build keyboards once in a while. I currently only have one keyboard but that's fine. I'll probably build another keyboard on 11.11. Theres discounts that day so I can build a keyboard at an affordable price !!!!11 </font>
